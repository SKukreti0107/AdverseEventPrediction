     Patient: I've been taking Amlodipine 5mg for my blood pressure for a few weeks, but I’ve started getting really swollen ankles.
    Doctor: I see. How long has the swelling been happening? Is it constant or does it come and go?
    Patient: It’s been getting worse over the last few days, especially after I’ve been standing for a while. It’s mostly around my ankles and calves.
    Doctor: Thank you for the details. Amlodipine can sometimes cause swelling in the legs or ankles. Are you experiencing any other symptoms, like dizziness or shortness of breath?
    Patient: I’ve been feeling a little lightheaded when I stand up quickly, but I haven’t had trouble breathing.
    Doctor: It sounds like the swelling could be a side effect of Amlodipine, and the dizziness may be from the drop in blood pressure. I think we might want to try switching to a different medication, like ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which can help manage your blood pressure without the same swelling.
    Patient: That sounds good. I’m also taking some aspirin for my heart condition and occasionally some ibuprofen for muscle pain.
    Doctor: Got it. Aspirin is fine, and we’ll make sure there are no issues with your new medication. Ibuprofen can sometimes affect kidney function, so it’s something to be mindful of while we adjust your treatment plan. We’ll keep monitoring your blood pressure and make sure we’re on the right track. How’s your heart doing otherwise?
